## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search via City / State / Country or Zipcode for weather forecast.
- Retrieve Weather at their current location.
- Retrieve Weather forecast for their specified "Home" location (saved in local storage) - if one has been specified.
- Save / Set their "Home" location view the application.
- Change their preferred "Units of measurement" (imperial/metric).
- Refresh the Weather forecast data.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS / Sass
- CSS Flexbox / Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

- How to separate SCSS files into smaller units for easier workflow.

### Continued development

• Continue refinement of project JS to improve safety and stability of application.
• Implement more granularity for weather conditions reflected within the application.
